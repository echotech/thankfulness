        <h2>Support Our Cause</h2>
        <p>Creating "Thankfulness" wasn't just a development project; it was a personal journey. As someone who has grappled with seasonal depression, I understand the profound value of finding moments of gratitude in our daily lives. This app was a beacon for my mental health, and I'm thrilled to share its benefits with others.</p>
        <p>If this app has been a source of light or comfort for you, consider supporting its ongoing development and maintenance. Every cup of coffee you buy for me not only fuels the app's continuous improvement but also serves as a warm reminder that we're in this together.</p>
